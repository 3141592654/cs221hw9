To compile program, use make.
Notably I used counting sort in the is_valid method of chromosome.cc to make sure there were no repeated values. I also decided to use a constant seed for my random number generators so that the results could be reproduced. I also added a compare_cities_ptr method to chromosome.hh. The idea is that if the customer requests an operation on two chromosomes which point to different cities, bad things are going to happen. You can do this quickly by comparing the city pointers. The operation could be valid even if the pointers are not the same if the two cities are copies of each other, but the customer really shouldn't be constructing their chromosomes in this way. In deme.cc, I decided to allow a parent to reproduce with itself. This isn't a very good model of human reproduction but there are animals that can do this.
